# README generator

## Purpose
This README generator is designed to create a README file based on a user's responses to a set of prompt questions. The user needs to clone the repository to use the README generator. Once cloned, the user needs to go to the 'Develop' directory of the project in the terminal. After the user types "node index.js" into the terminal, the prompt questions will appear. When all the questions are answered, an HTML file will be generated. This will be the README file. The file will be called 'index.html.'
